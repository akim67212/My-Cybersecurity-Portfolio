| The 5 W's  | Capture the 5 W's of an incident. **Who** caused the incident? An organized group of unethical hackers **What** happened? A ransomware security incident **When** did the incident occur? Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. **Where** did the incident happen? At a healthcare company **Why** did the incident happen? The incident occurred because unethical hackers were able to access the company’s computer system by sending targeted phishing emails to several employees of the company which contained malicious malware. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company’s systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note the left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |  |  |
| Additional notes | How can the healthcare company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |  |  |

| Additional notes | Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not? I found the Chronicle activity challenging because it was difficult for me to navigate the tool to find the information I needed at times. However, I eventually got more comfortable with the tool. Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed since taking this course? Yes, I now have a deeper understanding of detection and response after completing this course and what would be expected of me as a security analyst to handle incidents within an organization. Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why? The tool I enjoyed the most was the Splunk SIEM tool becaue I I enjoyed using the Search Processing Language (SPL) to locate log information that I was looking for. |  |  |
