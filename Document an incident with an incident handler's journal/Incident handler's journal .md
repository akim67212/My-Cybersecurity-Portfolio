| The 5 W's  | Capture the 5 W's of an incident. **Who** caused the incident? An organized group of unethical hackers **What** happened? A ransomware security incident **When** did the incident occur? Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. **Where** did the incident happen? At a healthcare company **Why** did the incident happen? The incident occurred because unethical hackers were able to access the company’s computer system by sending targeted phishing emails to several employees of the company which contained malicious malware. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company’s systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note the left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |  |  |
| Additional notes | How can the healthcare company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |  |  |
